# Soasis Ecommerce Project

- This is a project for the final Application Development project at IUH to demonstrate our learning and understanding throughout the course. We chose to develop an ecommerce shopping website as it is a complex and flexible application which challenged our understanding of the technologies involved.

- The purpose of this project was to build a ecommerce project where seller can register, add, edit/delete their shop product on their shop profile, receive orders from customers, see their total earnings and revenue payment, and also is for customers who can register, set their profile, search for their favorite products , order and purchase product from their favorite shops.
